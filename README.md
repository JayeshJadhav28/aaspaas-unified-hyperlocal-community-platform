# 🧭 Aaspaas — Unified Hyperlocal Community Platform

## 📖 Introduction

Tier-2 and Tier-3 communities primarily depend on fragmented WhatsApp groups and informal word-of-mouth networks for discovering local services, handling emergencies, and enabling neighborhood commerce. These systems are unverified, unreliable, and inefficient—leaving residents uncoordinated and local businesses invisible.

**Aaspaas** is an **Unified hyperlocal community platform** that digitizes neighborhood trust by connecting residents, local businesses, and service providers into a single, verified ecosystem.
